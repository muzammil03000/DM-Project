## Project Description 
The aim of our project it is used for security purpose.In RSA CRYPTOGRAPHY both public and private key are used for encrypt a message. our project logic is that the two large prime number are mulitiply and Multiplying these two numbers is easy to  determining the original prime number two large number n and n1 then take their modulus.

##Discrete Math Concepts Used ##
gcd 
prime number
phi function
key 
modulus 
###Example 1: PHYTON LANGUAGE USED###

```Phyton code:
s = input("Enter a message to encrypt: ")
print("Plain message: " + s  )
print("\n")
enc = encrypt_string(s)
print("Encrypted message: "+ enc )
```

##Problems Faced##

-Online classes(quarantine covid-19)
-net issue 
-Group coordination was not too good 
-logic issue (every one has diiferent opinion)

###Problem 1: I don't know how to Code###
Transfer to yourself to social sciences department. Blah blah blah. This is an example. Replace it with your own problem description and how you resolved it. 
Don't just blindly copy paste this report. This is a sample template file. 

###Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree###
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.  

##References##
- Mention and add [links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), references, books, research papers, code samples, you used to get help in the project.
- Use bullets like this.
- Mention all references. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- You see markdown is not that difficult.
- You are CS students not some tom harry from BBA SHE-B-A :-).
- You can and must learn to use markdown and Github. 
- All future project development will be down in something similar to GITHUB
