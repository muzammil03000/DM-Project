## Project Description 
The aim of our project it is used for security purpose.In RSA CRYPTOGRAPHY both public and private key are used for encrypt a message. our project logic is that the two large prime number are mulitiply and Multiplying these two numbers is easy to  determining the original prime number two large number n and n1 then take their modulus.

# 
## Discrete Math Concepts Used:
- Gcd 
- Prime number
- Phi function
- Key 
- Modulus 
### Example 1: PHYTON LANGUAGE USED

```Phyton code:
s = input("Enter a message to encrypt: ")
print("Plain message: " + s  )
print("\n")
enc = encrypt_string(s)
print("Encrypted message: "+ enc )
```
# 
## Problems Faced:

- Online classes(quarantine covid-19)
- Net issue 
- Group coordination was not too good 
- Logic issue (every one has diiferent opinion)

### Problem 1: Difficulty of understanding code: ###
There is a reason we tell people to start with a "Hello, world." Because at that point in their journey, accomplishing that means that have conquered a certain number of fundamentals. You understand how to compile, how to run, how to call a function and pass it parameters. Writing a clone of an existing program is another big step, almost as important as the hello world step, only at a different stage of your journey. When you are done with it, you have overcome certain challenges. You had to figure out where to start, how to plan it, how to organize it, how to deal with the bugs, give it a personal touch, and package it up at the end so it is a usable thing. Even when cloning a simple program, you are learning all of the process.

I see with novice developers. They've put in their time to learn the basics of a programming language or two and they feel py comfortable doing programming exercises, but they don't know how to apply what they've learned. It usually comes in a phrase similar to "I know how to program, but I don't know what to program." The responses are typically "do programming challenges", "contribute to an open source project", or "make a game."

Doing programming challenges is good mental practice, but they do little to help someone learn how to create a new program. Contributing to an open source project is a step up. You might learn about how a real project is structured and improve your skill with the programming language, but won't learn much about the full lifecycle of a project. Some projects are very complex too which can be intimidating for a novice.

### Problem 2: Our Parents forced me for a degree ###

Our parents obviously want you to succeed, but unlike a lot of parents think, studying “all day” is not what’s going to make that happen. A lot of people don’t need to study for too long to have great grades, while others study a lot and don’t get past an average grade, so the amount of studying isn’t what’s going to make you success, the quality of your studying is and each person has it different. Our parents have to understand that what they think is the right way, may actually not be the right way at all. Forcing you to study for the degree will only make it worse, you’ll become repulsed by studying and you won’t enjoy it because, well, you’re forced to do it, and nobody really likes to be forced to do something.

So, sit down and come up with the best way of making your study efficient to achieve your goals. If our parents keep pushing you to study for the degree all day, We should have a conversation with them about it and tell them that you have your study sorted out and you don’t need to study all day to succeed. Obviously, if you do this, you’re going to actually have to show them what you’re saying is true and works, otherwise there’s no point on trying to change things.
