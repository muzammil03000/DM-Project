## Project Description ##
Replace this text with the description of your project. Tell what the project was about. What you aimed to deliver in the project.

##Discrete Math Concepts Used ##
Replace this text with the desription of where in the project you used which discrete math concepts and how it is playing its role to make your project work. You may use more 3rd level heading to categorize this portion of the report as shown below.

###Example 1: Replace with Your Own###
And you may also add code samples from your project to support your description. 
```C++
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char* argv[]){
    printf("You may add some code of your liking if you want to support your description");
}
```

##Problems Faced##
Replace this text with the explaination of the problems you faced in the project, and how you resolved them. Again you can give each of your problems a heading of level 3.

###Problem 1: I don't know how to Code###
Transfer to yourself to social sciences department. Blah blah blah. This is an example. Replace it with your own problem description and how you resolved it. 
Don't just blindly copy paste this report. This is a sample template file. 

###Problem 2: My Parents forced me for a degree###
If you were not able to convince your parents not to force you for degree and now you are doing it for them then do it with your best effort and not half heartedly. There is no point wasting this time with finding a loop hole here and there and passing courses without actually learning anything.  

##References##
- Mention and add [links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), references, books, research papers, code samples, you used to get help in the project.
- Use bullets like this.
- Mention all references. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
- You see markdown is not that difficult.
- You are CS students not some tom harry from BBA SHE-B-A :-).
- You can and must learn to use markdown and Github. 
- All future project development will be down in something similar to GITHUB
